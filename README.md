## What is deployKF?

deployKF builds world-class Data and Machine Learning Platforms on __any Kubernetes cluster__, in any cloud or environment.
By combining the ease of a managed service with the flexibility of a self-hosted solution, deployKF enables you to deliver a sustainable platform which is still tailored to your organization's needs.

Our vision is that anyone with Kubernetes experience can effortlessly build, maintain, and support a custom Data and ML Platform for their organization, without requiring specialized MLOps knowledge.

Key features of deployKF include:

- Support for [__leading tools__](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/tools/#tool-index) from Kubeflow and more
- Intuitive and [__centralized configs__](https://www.deploykf.org/reference/deploykf-values/) to manage all aspects of the platform
- Seamless __in-place upgrades__ and config rollouts
- Connect with __existing cluster dependencies__ like Istio and cert-manager
- Native support for GitOps via ArgoCD

## Do you offer commercial support?

Yes! The founder of deployKF ([Mathew Wicks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewwicks/)), operates a US-based company named [Aranui Solutions](https://www.aranui.solutions) to provide commercial support and advisory services for organizations building ML & Data Platforms on Kubernetes.
